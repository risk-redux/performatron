# Welcome to `performatron`!

`performatron` is a part of the [Risk-Redux](https://risk-redux.io) project, which seeks to turn NIST frameworks into practical web applications.

For `performatron`, we focus on _[NIST SP 800-181, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-181/final)_. _NICE_ is essentially a framework for thinking about how we talk about cybersecurity work and the various types of roles responsible for doing it. `performatron`, in turn, seeks to be a career planning/development tool, and will be loosely based on the mechanics of a role-playing game (i.e., with quest mapping, experience point scoring, leveling up, etc.). For now, it's just a bit of a handy reference.
